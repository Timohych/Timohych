Hi, I'm Timohych 👋

### 🦀 Rust coder

---

#### 🛠️ What I do

- Code in **Rust** (and enjoy every minute of it)
- Make Music.
- Switch between **Neovim** and **Emacs** as my main editors
- Creator of **Emptiness Linux** — a unique distro with its own package manager and init system
- Currently building **Kettle**, a next-gen package manager

#### 🐧 About my setup

- Big fan of **Void Linux** (but working on **Hackintosh** at the moment)
- Love **DWM** and **Qtile** for tiling, but currently on **macOS Aqua**.
- Always tweaking, ricing, and experimenting with my desktop environment

#### 💻 Fun fact

I do all this on an almost dead ThinkPad T460s with a broken keyboard. Yep, it’s still my daily driver.
